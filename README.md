##No More Room in Hell

No More Room in Hell is a Half-Life 2 Source Mod. This repository is for submitting bugs and issues.

##Reporting Issues

Please press the 'S' key to start a search for similar issues already reported. *Include closed issues in your search.*

If the issue hasn't been reported yet, please feel free to submit the issue here with the following information.

* A short title, describing the issue. e.g. "Can't use X on nms_isolated"
* A detailed summary including
  * Version (Steam Closed Beta / 1.06 / Desura)
  * What happens
  * When does it happen
  * Steps to reproduce the issue (How did you do it?)
  * Screenshots
  * Youtube fraps captures of the issue
  * Developer Console Output (found by pressing the ` tilde key in game)
      * Place Developer Console output in a blockquote (add a > in front of each line)
  * And finally, if possible, system information
      * In Steam, (Help > System Information). Copy and paste into a blockquote (add a > in front of each line).

##If your game crashes

If while playing NMRiH, you inexplicably get thrown to the desktop with an error window (hl2.exe has stopped responding), do the following:

* Don't close the game until the error window gives you a prompt to close it (when the OK button appears)
* Follow the same directions as mentioned above in **Reporting Issues** but:
* Before you submit the issue, check your Dumps folder (located in steam\dumps) to see if there's a newly generated .mdmp file (They normally look like "crash_hl2.exe248123_1.dmp")
* If there is an .mdmp file, upload and attach it to your issue ticket and then submit it

If you use Linux or Mac, your crash files should appear in /tmp/dumps (if that's not right please let us know)

##Code of Conduct

Since this will ideally be used by the public to help centralize and organize the issues present in the mod, the team would appreciate if you can remember the following:

* Do not insult, harass, or demean anyone.
* Do not intentionally multi-post an issue.
* Avoid using ALL CAPS when creating an issue report.
* Do not repeatably update an open issue, saying that the issue persists.
* Do not use exploits for your own gain, this tracker is up in goodwill to allow the public to help the dev team out with bug reporting.

Reminder: NMRiH is a HL2 modification so some issues that you'll find may be common throughout various Source 2007 based mods (ex: clientregistry.blob error) or may not even be issues at all.

##Feature Requests

To a lesser extent you *can* request certain things for the team to look into, such as new specific entities that mappers can use to make more creative objectives. However, we'll overlook requests that are either ill-fitting for the mod's subject or just plain silly (we are not adding handheld GAU-8 Avengers or zombified animals).
